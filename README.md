## Description

<<<<<<< HEAD
_A game that uses an asynchronous javascript and api to generate a random dinosaur name places it as a property within a constructor. Another property on the object returns the name ran through a method that outputs the name as underscores. Once the user inputs a letter we check if it is contained in the dinosaur name adn replace the underscores in the proper positions with the letter input, or we draw a piece of the hangman character. Once there are no more underscores in the name the game is won and we give the user the option to play again with a button that reloads the webpage. If the hangman is drawn completely (and the countdown reaches 0) the game is lost and the lose screen displays with a button that also reloads the page._
